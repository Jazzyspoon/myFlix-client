Test this project using Parcel: 'parcel src/index.html'.
If there are any errors, remove the babelrc file from the project and proceed. Parcel 7+ no longer needs babel configuration and having it as part of the project is part of my tutorial.
This project is a react based front end for my movieFlix App I am currently working on in the Career Foundry program. It uses html, javascript, scss, bootstrap, react and uses react, redux, babel, parcel as dependencies (look into package json for dependency details).
