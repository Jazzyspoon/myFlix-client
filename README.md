This MovieFlix project is a React-based frontend for my movieFlix App I am currently working on in the Career Foundry program. It uses html, javascript, scss, bootstrap 4, react and uses react, redux, babel, parcel as dependencies (look into package json for exact dependency details and versions). It access a Rest API that I designed using mongodb/mongodbcompass and is cluster-hosted on Heroku.com.

Test this project folder using Parcel from the project folder: 'parcel src/index.html'.
If there are any errors, you could possibly remove the babelrc file from the project and proceed. Parcel 7+ no longer needs babel configuration, but having it as part of the project is part of my tutorial at Career Foundry.
